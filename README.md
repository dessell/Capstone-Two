<p>This project explores the historical competitiveness of European soccer leagues over a 24 year period between 1995-2018. </p>
<p>While the data contains a 25th year, the 2019/2020 season is incomplete due to the Covid-19 pandemic halting league play. </p>
<p>For the sake of consistency, the project exclusively focuses on domestic competition, and not competitions such as the UEFA Champion's League or UEFA Cup/Europa League.</p>
<p>As a top flight league exists for every country in Europe, the scope of research focuses on what are traditionally the five most prestigious league competitions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>English Premier League </li>
  <li>Spain's La Liga</li>
  <li>Italian Serie A</li>
  <li>German Bundesliga</li>
  <li>French Ligue 1</li>
</ul>
<p>The research finds a growing divide over time between the top-tier clubs in each league versus the rest of the field. This divide not only includes margin of victory over 
the next best teams, but a smaller number of unique winners in the last decade. The results indicate a lack of competitiveness throughout the top European leagues, which may
incentivize the elite clubs (along with the obvious financial implications) to break away from domestic leagues and create an exclusive continental super league.</p>

<p>This presentation was given at the beginning of April 2021. Two weeks later, the controversial European Super League was announced to universal condemnation among fans. The club
owners eventually scrapped their plans, but all indications remain that this is the direction European soccer will head in the 2020s.</p>
